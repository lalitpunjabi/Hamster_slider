# Hamster Wheel Slider
This project features a fun, interactive hamster wheel animation controlled by an adjustable slider. Users can control the speed of the hamster running in the wheel using the slider, providing a playful and engaging experience.

The hamster's movement is designed with CSS and JavaScript, and the animation speed is tied to the input range slider, allowing for a dynamic and customizable visual. This project was originally created by "masahito" and is a great demonstration of combining CSS animations with JavaScript interactions.
